\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting:
	21:00 - 21:30
	\item Purposes of meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To install guides at the robot.
	  
	  \item To elaborate concept of throwing of balls to baskets.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item It was decided to install axle around which rotates bucket with the balls on the top guide because our strategy is to carry movable basket behind the robot. There is tube which diametr is slighly larger than the diametr of big ball at the top of the bucket. The bucket rotates and the balls rolls to the basket.

      \item It has been estimated that optimal location of the axil around which will rotate the bucket is 20cm from the bottom of guide. Additional lifting height allowed to refuse from the one pair of slats. So three slats left.
      
      \item The guides were installed to the robot.
      
      \item It was decided to test the working of the lift after installation of the guides. The belt coped with this task but the axles bended. It was decided to install the more strong axles. In addition  pairs of slats extracted to the different heights. So it was decided to connect the pairs of slats rigidly.

    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Guides was installed to the robot. 
	  
      \item It was elaborated concept of the throwing balls to the baskets.
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To assemble device that will rotate the bucket.
	  
	  \item To buy the more strong axles.
	  
	  \item To buy the aluminium profile for connection guides.
    \end{enumerate}

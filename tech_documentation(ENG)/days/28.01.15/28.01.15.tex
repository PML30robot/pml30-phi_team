\subsubsection{28.01.15 (Competition)}
\begin{center}
	1-st day of competition "Robofest-Ural"
\end{center}
Today there was protection of engineering book. Also we trained on the control robot and corrected programme of autonomous period. During the protection of engineering book judges asked us tell about our robot in English. We did it not very well. We need to prepare the protection of engineering book in English. \newline
Improvements that were done:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Robot lost the rolling goal during the fast moving because servo on MCB had not enough power. So it was decided to replace it to more powerful. Also the slopes for alignment rolling goal were moved higher because they hooked the base of rolling goal.

	\item It was made the mount for a flag.

	\item Some balls hit the top edge of the bucket because new gripper launched balls too highly. The balls didn't get to the bucket fell to the blades and stopped them. So it was decided to expand the hole in the front partof the bucket. Also they were installed plates that will prevent to loss balls if they will fly too hughly

	\item Programme of autonomous period from the parking zone was debugged in accordance with the characteristics of the field. Programme of autonomous period from the ramp wasn't corrected because all teams had programme for start from the ramp.

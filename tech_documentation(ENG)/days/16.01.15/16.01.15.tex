\subsubsection{16.01.15}
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting: 16:30 - 21:30.
	
	\item Purposes of meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To train on the control robot.
		
		\item To identify disadvantages of construction or programme.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Today we trained on the control of robot. Programme worked well. The lift didn't shake. Gutter and guideway for balls allowed maximal accuracy of throwing balls into the basket. Now we need from 30 to 60 seconds in order to capture 3 big balls (we has only three) and put their into basket that fixed stationary. But in a game we'll pull the rolling goal behind the robot so we will not waste time on the entrance to the bucket. We plans to reduce the time of collecting one portion of balls to 30 or less seconds.
		
		\item It was found that some balls go sideways and doesn't get into the bucket. So it was decided to install additional slopes that directs balls into the bucket.

        \item Today they was elaborated variants of autonomuos perid:
        \begin{enumerate}
        	
        	\item Ride from the ramp put the ball into 60cm goal and into the center goal. Move the 60cm goal to the parking zone (maximum 130 points).
        	
        	\item Ride from the ramp put the ball into the 60cm goal and move it to the parking zone. Then return to 90cm goal put the ball into this goal and move it to the parking zone (maximum 120 points).
        	
        	\item Ride from the ramp put the ball into the 60cm goal capture 90cm goal by additional MCB, move their to the parking zone. Then release 60cm goal and put the ball into 90cm goal(maximum 120 points).
        	
        \end{enumerate}

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item  Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item We had trainings on the control robot.
		
		\item Gripper for balls was improved.
		
		\item They were elaborated strategies of autonomuos period.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To train on the control robot.
		
		\item To choose the strategy of autonomuos period and implement it.
			
	\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting: 16:30 - 20:30.
	
	\item Purposes of meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To train on the control robot.
		
		\item To make an additional hook for autonomuos ball and additional gripper for rolling goal.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item During the training it was found that some big balls don't leave the blade and start moving back but stuck between the axis of the gripper and transverse beam. So the beam was fixed higher. But the balls still slightly stuck. It will need to move the beam more high.

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Gripper for balls was impoved.
		
		\item It was installed mount for servo for additional gripper for rolling goals but servo wasn't installed.
		
        \item Additional hook for autonomuos ball wasn't made.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To make an additional hook for autonomuos ball.
		
		\item To finish additional gripper for rolling goal.
		
		\item To train on the control robot and reduce time of collecting 5 balls.

	\item Purposes of the meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To fix rigidity rib that was broken on the last lesson.
		
		\item To set up two axes on the lift.
		
		\item To fix the belt on the lift.
		
		\item To test the lift.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Work that has be done:
	\begin{enumerate}

		\item Two other crossbars were fixed in holes and fixed with hot melt.

		\item Lift was tested by pulling the belt by hands. We found that extracting the lift demands some effort. 2 drives must cope with this task. Inner pair rails did not fall under their own weight during the lowering. We decided to increase their weight and reduce friction.
		
		\item Mechanism of extracting the lift was installed on the robot (hereinafter it will be called as MEL).

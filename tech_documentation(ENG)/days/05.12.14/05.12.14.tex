	  \item We measured the space allocated for bucket. Optimal sizes of bucket were choose.
	  
	  \item Programme of autonomous period was improved. Function that convert reading of encoder to centimeters was removed. It allowed solve the problem with turning to parking zone.	  
	  
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results:  
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item П-shaped rib of rigidity was installed.
	  
	  \item Programme of autonomous period was improved.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To create the drawing for new bucket.
	  
	  \item To choose and buy the material for bucket.
	  
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{18.03.15}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting:
	19:00 - 21:00
	\item Purposes of meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To make model of the lift.		  
			  
    \end{enumerate}
   

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item It was found that we has only 7 beams. But for mount for motors that rotates wheels we need 12 (6 for each wheels pair). So it was decided to use 4 beams (2 for each pair) and fix short beams between the beam that limits base of robot and mount for wheel. So we need only 4 long beams and 16 short (4 for each wheel).

		 		        \end{figure}
		\item They were made models of the slats. It was starting assembling model of the lift.

    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Result: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Mount for motors that rotates wheels was improved.
	  
	  \item Model of the slat was created
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To make model of the lift.
		
		\item To estimate location of center of gravity.
		
		\item To estimate optimal location for wheels.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{26.01.15}
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting: 17:15 - 22:00.
	
	\item Purposes of meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	
		\item To connect the servo that moves additional gripper for rolling goal.
		
		\item To train on the control robot.
		
        \item To install protection for NXT-brick and Samantha-module.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Servo that moves additional gripper for rolling goal was connected with servocontroller and it was added control of it in programmes of autonomous and tele op period.
		
		\item Protection for NXT and Samantha-module was installed.

        \item It was invented the idea for improvement gripper for balls. Servo of continous rotation that moves gripper rotates too slow. So it was decided to replace it on two Lego-motors that arranged on both sides of the axis. Motors were installed and it was made metalic protection for their..

	   \item The new gripper was tested. Result positive. Speed of rotation of gripper increased threefold. Balls are captured very fast and dispersed so that they fly into the bucket. So they don't stuck between the axis and beam. The new gripper will allow us to reduse the time of collecting balls.
	   
	   \item 28th - 29th of January we'll come to competition that will be in Perm. So today we need to train and package the robot for transportation.

	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Servo that moves additional gripper for rolling goal was connected with servocontroller.
		
		\item Protection for NXT and Samantha was installed.
		
        \item Gripper for balls was improved. Result positive
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To train on the control robot.
		
		\item To package the robot for transportation it to Perm.

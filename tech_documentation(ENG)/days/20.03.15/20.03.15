\subsubsection{20.03.15}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting:
	16:00 - 22:00
	\item Purposes of meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To install the second plate on the mount for servo that moves MOB.
		
		\item To fix the lift on the robot's base.
		
		\item To fix MEL. 		  
			  
    \end{enumerate}
   

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item MEl was fixed on the robot's base.
		
		\item Elements of robot's base were connected with each other by additional beams. So it became more rigidly.
		
		\item It was started fixing of the lift. Also it was decided to fix crossbars of the lift more reliable.
		
		\item The second plate was installed on the mount for servo. So the corner with holes was connected with the back part of the mount and it stopped bend.

				 		        \end{figure}
		\item It was found that bucket can hook edges of axles around which rotates wheels. So it was decided to make new bucket that will more narrow and longer.				 		        		
      
    \end{enumerate}

		\item Result: 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item MEL was fixed.
			
			\item MOB was strenthened.	
			
			\item Base of the robot was strengthened.
			
			\item Lift partially fixed.
			
		\end{enumerate}    
    
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}	
		
		\item To fix the lift and make mounts for crossbars more reliable.
		
		\item To estimate location of center of gravity.
		
		\item To estimate optimal location for wheels.
		
		\item To fix wheels.
		
		\item To make new bucket.

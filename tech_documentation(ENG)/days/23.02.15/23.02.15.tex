	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting: 16:00 - 20:00.
	
	\item Purposes of meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To make the mount for the second servo for MOB.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item It was decided to install the second gear on the axis around which turns the bucket. The second servo will rotate this gear. It was decided not connect the shafts of servos because they will not coaxial. So servos will tremble. But if we'll connect the second servo with the axis through the gear the backlash between the gears will compensate not coaxial arrangement of servos.
		
		\item The second gear was installed.

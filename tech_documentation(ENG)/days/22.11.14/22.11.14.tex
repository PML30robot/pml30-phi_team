\subsubsection{22.11.14 (Competition)}
\begin{center}
	2-nd day of the competition "Robofest-South".
\end{center}
Today there were qualifying matches and protection of engineering books.
\newline 
Results of matches: 2 wins from 4. 
\newline
Results of protection of engineering books still unknown.
\newline
Main problems identified during matches:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item There is low accuracy during throwing balls to the rolling goal. This was due to we didn't give enough time to trainings.
	
	\item The wire of MOB often hooked to slats and torned. Due to this it was impossible throw balls to baskets.
	
\end{enumerate} 
Improvements that were done:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It was wrote programme of autonomous period that includes exit from the ramp and throwing autonomous balls to 60cm rolling goal.
	
	\item It was wrote the programme that allows to control the lift by buttons of NXT. This programme convenient if we need to extract the lift for working on the construction of robot.
	
	\item Also it was wrote the programme of autonomous period from the parking zone. It allows to knock down the fence when it is in the one position from three.
	
	\item One crossbar bended due to the high loads. So it was strengthened by the metallic tube from set Tetrix. It corrected this problem but it was decided to replace aluminium crossbars to steel.

	\item There was installed on MCB the slopes of the tie-rods for aligning rolling goals. In the future we planned to replace the screeds  to plastic strips because they often brokes.

	\item Protection of wheels was improved . Now there is a cardboard protection but we planned make to it metallic.

	\item During the one match NXT-brick fell off from the robot. So we fixed it as effectively as possible.

	\item It was turned out that during extracting the lift the top pair of slats rises on the last. It doesn't allow to overturn the bucket up until the lift wasn't extracted fully. We must to extract the lift fully and then to lower this to needed heigh for throwing balls to any goal. We waste a lot of time so it was decided to correct this problems after returning from the competition.

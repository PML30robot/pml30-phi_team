\subsubsection{19.11.14}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting:
	18:00 - 22:00
	\item Purposes of the meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To install limiters of movement of the crossbar.
	  
	  \item To fix NXT-brick at the robot.
	  
	  \item To train on the control of robot.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item It was installed limiters of crossbar's movement.

      \item It was turned out that metal mesh can to hook a lift and interfere with it's movement. The bucket was covered by tape. It allowed make it's surface smooth.
      
      \item NXT-brick was fixed at the robot stationary. The new place is better than previous because now it locates higher and it will be harder to damage it in the event of a collision.

      \item We couldn't train on the control robot due to working on robot's construction.
          
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Trainings at the control of robot were not conducted.
	  	
	  \item NXT-brick was fixed on the robot.
	  
      \item It was corrected the problem with hooking of bucket during the lift.
      
      \item Limiters of crossbar's movement was installed on the lift.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To continue the trainings on the control of robot.
	  
    \end{enumerate}

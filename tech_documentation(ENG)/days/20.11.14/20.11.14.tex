	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting:
	16:00 - 22:00
	\item Purposes of the meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To train on the control of robot
	  
	  \item To connect the encoders for orientation of robot in the autonomuos period.
	  
	  \item To extend the tube of the bucket for throwing balls to baskets.
	  
	  \item Packaging robot for transportation to the competition "Robofest-South".
	  
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item It was turned out that some balls don't get into the bucket and stay in the inner space of the robot. So the slopes was extended to reach the bucket. So balls get into the bucket.

	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting: 15:00 - 20:00
	
	\item Purposes of meeting:  
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To install powerful servo on the MOB.
		
		\item To replace broken motor.
		
		\item To install slopes for aligning the rolling goal.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item After the last competition we decided to return to concept of the bucket that was elaborated on 01.12.14. Now we have all the resources needed for making it.
		
		\item Bought a more powerful servo. We choose the servo that had the dimensions of the servo from the Tetrix set but a force 17kg/cm (versus the servo from Tetrix set, which had a force 4kg/cm). This servo wasn't installed today.

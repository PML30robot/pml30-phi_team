\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting:
	17:00 - 20:00
	\item Purposes of the meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To write a program of control the gripper and include it to the robot control program.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Program of servo control was wrote. Servo rotates by pressing the button. It stops after the operator removes his hand from the button. During the tests it turned out that it uncomfortable for operator. All commands are served from one joystick at the moment. But later the first operator will be responsible for only traffic control and everything else will make by the operator â„–2.
      
      \item During the tests of gripper on banks (balls we haven't at that time) it turned out that it instead of capturing them repels them. We understood that ties are fixed on the contrary.
      
      \item It was decided to relocate the front crossmember further from the axis so that it does not prevent the movement of the brush-ties.
      
      \item It was decided to fix ties on the axis by a hot-melt adhesive. But we didn't have a hot-melt adhesive on this meeting so it was decided to make it on the next meeting.
      
      \item It was turned out that the travel stops furniture racks can not withstand weight of lift. It was decided to strengthen the stops.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item A simple program of control the capture has been written.
	  
      \item Gripper was tested in action. They was developed ideas to improve it.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To create a final version of gripper.
	  
	  \item To change management program for the gripper of more convenient.
	  
	  \item To strengthen the travel stops furniture racks.

    \end{enumerate}

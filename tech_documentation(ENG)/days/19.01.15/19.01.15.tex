\subsubsection{19.01.15}
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting: 17:30 - 21:00.
	
	\item Purposes of meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To continue the working on the programme of autonomuos period.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item The front right motor was removed and it was installed motor with encoder. Now our robot has encoder from each side.
		
		\item Idea of programme of autonomuos period from the ramp was changed: ride from the ramp, put the small ball into 60cm goal and capture it. Then turn and release 60cm on the line that connect 90cm goal and the parking zone. Then put the ball into 90cm goal and capture it. To move the 90cm goal to the parking zone and push the 60cm goal. The programme of moving was wrote. The throwing balls into the goals will add when we'll have original goals.
		
		\item It was elaborated special hook for throwing the first autonomous ball into the goal. The ball doesn't fall from it during the moving but when robot rides to the goal, rise the lift and starts lower it the ball touch the edge of the basket and falls to the goal.

	   \item It was found that the middle pair of slats falls when the lift is lowered. So they were installed additional limiters.

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Changed programme of autonomous period was wrote.
		
		\item It was installed front right motor with encoder.
		
        \item They were installed limiters for slats.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To write the programme of autonomuos period for start from the parking zone.
		
		\item To train on the control robot.

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting: 17:00 - 21:30.
	
	\item Purposes of meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
	    \item To make and install the gutter.
			
		\item To fix the new wire on the lift.
		
		\item To test the gutter.
	    
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item The wire was held and servo was connected.

		\item It was decided to replace slopes on MCB. They were installed metalic slopes instead of plastic. Metalic slopes will not bend and align rolling goal better than plastic.

        \item Gutter with folding part was tested. Balls falls vertically. It allows high accuracy of throwing balls into the basket. 
		
		\item The folding part of the gutter must be folded because otherwise robot doesn't get into regulated dimensions. It was decided to connect it with bucket by fishing line. When bucket overturns line stretched and this element reclines. It was decided to make it on the next meeting.

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item The wire was held and servo was connected.
		
		\item They were made metalic slopes for alignment rolling goal.
		
        \item The gutter and folding element were made and installed on the robot.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To connect the folding element (hereinafter it will call as guideway for balls) of the gutter with the bucket.
			
	\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting: 20:00 - 22:30.
	
	\item Purposes of meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To test the ramp for ball with the slope angle 60 degrees and estimate optimal distance between the axis of the gripper and ramp.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item It was made cardboard layout of the ramp with slope angle 60 degrees.
		 		         \begin{figure}[H]
		 		         	\begin{minipage}[h]{0.2\linewidth}
		 		         		\center  
		 		         	\end{minipage}
		 		         	\begin{minipage}[h]{0.6\linewidth}
		 		         		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.07]{days/02.03.15/images/01}}
		 		         		\caption{Cardboard layout of the ramp}
		 		         	\end{minipage}
		 		         \end{figure}		
		
		
		\item It was estimated that optimal distance between the ramp and axis is 5.5cm.
		
		\item During the tests of the ramp it was found that balls can stuck between the slopes when the ball that captures by more short side of blade is closer to the ramp than the second ball. This was because the blade bended when it touch the ball that captures by long side and didn't touch the ball that was closer to the ramp. So it was decided to cut the blades on 2 part because in this case blades touchs both balls. Also we planned to turn halfs of the blades relative to each other. It will increase the quality of capturing balls because one ball will captured before the second so they will not prevent to each other.

		 		         	\begin{minipage}[h]{0.6\linewidth}
		 		         		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{days/02.03.15/images/02}}
		 		         		\caption{Cut blade}
		 		         	\end{minipage}
		 		         \end{figure}	
		\item It was decided to make the bucket and then make ramp for it. If it will need we'll can to increase the slope angle.		 		         	
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item The ramp with slope angle 60 degrees was tested.
		
		\item Gripper for balls was improved.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To make the bucket where balls will not stuck.
		
		\item To make the ramp for bucket.
			
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting:
	14:00 â€“ 20:30
	\item Purposes of meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To change the construction of lift.
		
		\item To connect the encoder to one of motors which moves the lift.
		
		\item To add a restriction of movement to the lift control program.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Construction of the lift was changed.
		
		\item Encoder was installed to left motor of the MEL.

		\item Restriction of movemnt was added to the lift control programme. If the encoder's readings exceed the allowable value, the lift stops.
		
		\item Tests of the lift were successful. The new construction has no problem with widening the lift.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:  
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The lift was finished.
		
		\item Tests of the lift were succsessful.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To continue working on the mechanism of overturning the bucket and MCB.
		
	\end{enumerate}

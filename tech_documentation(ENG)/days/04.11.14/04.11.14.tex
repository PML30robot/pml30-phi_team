\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting:
	14:00 â€“ 20:30
	\item Purposes of meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To change the construction of lift.
	  
	  \item To connect encoder to one of motors which moves lift.
	  
	  \item To add to programme of control of the lift stopper of it's moving.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Construction of the lift was changed.
      
      \item Encoder was installed to left motor of the MEL.

      \item Stopper of moving of the lift was added to programme. If encoder's  readings exceed the allowable value lift stops.
      
      \item Tests of the lift were successful. The new construction has no problem with extracting lift.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results:  
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item The lift was finished.
	  
	  \item Tests of the lift were succsessful.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To continue working on mechanism of overturning bucket and MCB.
	  
    \end{enumerate}

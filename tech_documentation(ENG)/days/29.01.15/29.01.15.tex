\subsubsection{29.01.15 (Соревнования)}
\begin{center}
	2-nd day of competition "Robofest-Ural"
\end{center}
Today there were qualification mathces.
\newline 

Improvements that were done:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It was installed the screw as the hook for autonomous ball because a wire hook bended and didn't provided a guaranteed hit ball to the goal.

	\item The second team from our circle "PML 30 ${\psi}$" needed a powerful servo because they had failure of servo that overturns bucket for balls. So we were forced to remove powerful servo from MCB.
	
\end{enumerate}

Results of competition:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We took the 3-rd place by the results of qualification matches.
	
	\item We made it to the final match because team "${\lambda}$" that took the first place by the results of qualification matches choosed us.
	
	\item Our alliance won the final match.
	
	\item We took the first place in nomination "Engineering book".
	
	\item We took the 1-st place on team standings.
\end{enumerate}

Summing up:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Success in competition:
  \begin{enumerate}
	\item We took the prize in nomination "Alliance-winner".
	
	\item We took the first place in nomination "Engineering book".
	
	\item We didn't implemented all advantages of our robot: autonomous period worked in only one qualification match. In the final match opponent that left his zone and blocked the road for our robot prevented to perform autonomous period. Collecting the balls to 90cm goal in driver-control periodit was complicated by the fact that the small balls got under the bottom of our robot. It deteriorated of controllability of the robot. Also the wheels got on the stick-stopper. So the robot lost the 90cm goal.
	
	\item We performed our main task - to train on the original field before "Robofest-2015" that will be 11th - 13th of February in Moscow.
	
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item Our mistakes and disadvantages of construction:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item The main problem was that the robot ran over the small balls and the stick.
  	
  	\item We prepared the programme of autonomous period badly. So it was debugged only at the end of competition.
  	
  	\item Sometimes balls stuck in the bucket because it has a narrowing in a top part. So we were must to retutn the bucket to the start position and overturn it again. So some balls fell outside the bucket. It will need to add an intermediate position of the bucket in order to the congestion dissapeare and balls don't fall from the bucket.
  	
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item Tasks for the next meetings:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item To make programme of autonomous period from the ramp.
  	
  	\item To make the gripper for balls that can to collect only big balls.
  	
  	\item To imrove the protection from the small balls and the stick.
  	
  	\item To improve MCB so that it don't lose the rolling goal during the fast moving.
  	
  	\item To add to the programme of control robot an intermediate position of the bucket.
  	
  	\item To prepare the protection of engineering book in English.
  	  	
  	\item To install field control system for trainings in a most real conditions.
  	
  	\item To install plexiglass protection of robot.
  	
  \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{25.11.14}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting:
	17:00 - 21:00
	\item Purposes of the meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To unravel wiers and hold to their by the most accurate way.
		
		\item To increment count of motors, which move the lift, from two to four.
		
		\item Remove the transmission from the mechanism of extracting lift.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The wiring has been redone so wire doesn't mixed and not fills too much place inside the robot and doesn't prevent to change of battery.

		\item It was started alteration of MEL.
		
		\item We add to construction two motors. So it was need to install another one driver of motors for control their. It was installed driver instead of the servo controller. Servo controller was installed to more available place. It will be easier to connect additional servos.
		
		\item All drivers of motors were connected to NXT-brick to the port 1. Servo controller was connected to port 2. Initialization of controllers was changed in all programmes.

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Wiring was optimized.
		
		\item Driver of motors was installed.
		
		\item Servo controller was installed on more available place.
		
		\item It was started alteration of mechanism of extracting of the lift.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To finish the alteration of MEL.
		
		\item To elaborate concept of the new gripper for balls.
		
	\end{enumerate}

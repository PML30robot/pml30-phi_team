	\item It was turned out that base of rolling goal does not pass under the bottom of the robot. It doesn't allow to bring the goal to the robot as close as possible. It was decided to increase clearance of back part of robot.
	
	\item Beams on the MCB was sawed to desired length and were fixed. But MCB was changed due to problems with second servo that bursting with beams. Faulty servo was removed and beams were fixed rigidly.

	14:00 - 20:00
	\item Purposes of the meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To change the gripper for balls.
		
		\item To test the new gripper.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item They were installed plastic blades on the axle.

		\item Tests.
		
		\item The transverse beam prevented to working of gripper because blades more stiffness than ties. So the beam was removed. It was decided to install П-shaped rib of rigidity. Horizontal crossbar of it will locate higher and will not prevent to working of the gripper.
		
		\item The axle of gripper was located too low. So it was decided to increase clearance of front wheels. After incrementation of clearance gripper hasn't any problem with capture of big balls.

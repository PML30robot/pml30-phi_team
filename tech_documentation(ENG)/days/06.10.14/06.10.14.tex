\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting:
	21:00 - 21:30
	\item Purposes of the meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Begin to write a program to control the robot by joystick.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item It was written two programs for test the wheel base: moving in a straight direction and turning around. It showed good results during driving in a straight direction. During the turning around robot highly shakes. It is due to the high coefficient of friction between the wheels and floor. So the wheels could not slip on the floor and jumped up and down. In general it does not affect the accuracy of turning.
      
      \item  As a result of the discussion it was choosen the type of lift - sliding rails, the base of which are rigidly fixed to the frame of the robot. This design is most reliable and the easiest to implement.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
      \item  Type of lift was choosen.

    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To buy furniture slats to create lift.

    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{08.01.15}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting: 14:00 - 23:00
	
	\item Purposes of meeting:  
	\begin{enumerate}
		
	  \item To install powerful servo on MOB.
		
	  \item To install the bucket on the new MOB and test it.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
	  \item The beam from Tetrix set was fixed on the servo. It was decided to fasten the bucket on it.
		
	  \item New servo was tested. Result positive: servo can to overturn the bucket with five balls when it fixed to the servo to a top part. It allows to us install MOB on the top of slat and crossbars will not to preclude overturning bucket. So we will not should to raise the lift to the top position and then lower it on height of the basket  for throwing balls to any basket.
		
	  \item Servo was installed on the lift.

      \item It was decided to fix beam to the servo by transmission with gear ratio 1:1. It will reduce the load on the shaft of servo.
      
      \item Leading gear was installed on the servo.
      
      \item Axis with the driven gear was fixed by two plates. One plate was fixed to the slat and the second - to mount for servo.
      
      \item The bucket was installed to MOB.

      \item It was found that screws on the mount for servo can to unwind. So the second plate stagger and driven gear moves away from the leading gear and MOB can't to work. It was decided to connect the shaft of servo with the axis by additional plate.
      
 	\end{enumerate}
 	\item Results:
 	\begin{enumerate}
 		
 	  \item MOB almost finished.
 				
 	\end{enumerate}
 	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
 	\begin{enumerate}
 		
 	  \item To make and install plate that will connect shaft of servo with the axis.
 				
 	  \item To make and install the wire that connect MOB with servocontroller.
 				
 	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

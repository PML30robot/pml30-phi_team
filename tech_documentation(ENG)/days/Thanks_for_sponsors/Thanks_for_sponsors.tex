    We liked to do interesting and custom project that include engineering part and working with new people.
    
    Our team planned to continue to do robotics. It is our first year when we take part in FTC so we will do it in a next year. We'll correct all our mistakes and we will much better.
    
    We don't know what we'll do in a future but we shure that this time will not be a waste.
    
    We are thankful to company FIRST for organizing of this competition.
    
    Also we thank our sponsors: company PTC and it's Russian representative "Irisoft" and charitable foundation "Finist" for support. Also we thank Physics-Mathematics Lyceum â„–30 and it's director Alexey Tretyakov for providing comfortable conditions for preparation to competition.

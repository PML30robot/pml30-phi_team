	\item Purposes of the meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To make the gripper for balls that can to collect only big balls.
		
		\item To install field control system for trainings in a most real conditions.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Balades were cut to desired lengh. So the gripper captures only big balls but it can to capture small ball by accident because it can to get into the bucket behind the big ball. But this situations were rarely. So that result positive.

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item The gripper for ball can to capture only big balls.
		
		\item The wire for NXT motor was protected.
		
        \item Field control system wasn't setup.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To add to the programme of control robot an intermediate position of the bucket.
		
		\item To train on the control robot.
		
        \item To make programme of autonomous period from the ramp.
        
        \item To imrove the protection from the small balls and the stick.
        
        \item To setup field control system.

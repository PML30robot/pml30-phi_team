        \item It was decided to make one durable wire because standard wires often brokes. We took USB-wire and cut it's ends. This wire was threaded into the elastic tube (the hose for a aquarium) for additional protection. Then plugs were soldered on the wire for connection this wire with the servo controller or another wire. After that the wire was tested by multitester for fractures. Fractures weren't found.

\subsubsection{09.03.15}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting:
	16:00 - 23:00
	\item Purposes of meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To solve the problem with NXT.
	  
	  \item To make the ramp for bucket.
			  
    \end{enumerate}
   
	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		 \item The problem with NXT was solwed.
		 
		 \item Programme of control robot was tested. Result is positive: button works without problems.
		 
		 \item It was found that when we turn on power robot doesn't work during the 1 second. So it was decided that we will not off power before autonomous period. 
		 
		 \item It was decided to change wheel base. We looked next variants.
		 \begin{enumerate}
		 	\item To move the front motors to back part and install instead of them omni-wheels. Our robot will turn faster and we'll can increase width of gripper for balls.
		 	
		 	\item To move front motors to the top of beam and connect the wheel by gears. We'll can increase width of gripper but we'll need disassemble less elements.
		 	
		 	\item The same variant as the first but motors will fixed in the central part. They will connected with wheels by gears. We'll can to increase width of gripper, robot will turn faster and load on motor's shaft will reduced and reducers of motors will not break
		 \end{enumerate}
		 \item We choosed the third variant because it solves three problems.
		 
		 \item It was found that motor controllers that fixed on the bottom doesn't allow to fix motors. So it was decided to move them on the another place.
		 
		 \item It was decided to fix the beam on MEL and install controllers on it.
		 		 
		 \item The beam was fixed and controllers were removed from the old place.

		 \item In addition MEL was strengthened by additional plate.

		 \item Today we got two powerful servos. One servo was installed on the MCB the second - on MOB.

		\item Also the gutter was fixed better so that it doesn't stagger.
		 		         \begin{figure}[H]

    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Result: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Bucket was finished.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To solve the problem with NXT.
		
		\item To make new ramp for balls.
    \end{enumerate}

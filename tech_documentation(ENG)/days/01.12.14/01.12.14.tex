	  \item П-shaped rib of rigidity wasn't installed.
	  
	  \item It was decided to create the bucket so that: on the bottom of the bucket there is pallet 7cm in height. Ramp fix on a front part of it. Then there is part that open on the front. It needs for getting balls into the bucket. Then the bucket starts to narrow and at the top there is the hole with sizes of big ball. Uniform narrowing doesn't allow to balls stuck inside the tube.After the bucket there is gutter that fixed on the top pair of slat so that balls falls from the overturned bucket to a goal. The gutter ends by a folding element that directs to balls vertically.

\begin{enumerate} 
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting:
	19:00 - 20:30
	\item Purposes of the meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To test program of the robot control by two joysticks.
		
		\item To include in the program of the robot control program of management MCB.
		
		\item To replace the gears in the MCB into smaller.
		
		\item To choose materials for bucket for balls.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item MCB takes up too much space because there were the large gear on the second servo. So it was decided to replace them to smaller ones. It was decided to remove two small gears that were used to mount for crossbar since all small gears have been used. It was created special attachment instead of the gears.

		\item Gears in the MCB were replaced to smaller ones.

		\item It was decided to use metal mesh with small cells for creation a ball's bucket. It has sufficient rigidity and it bends easy. Also the grid has a low weight. That is important because it will be rise to 120 cm. Additionally we'll can see how much balls are in the bucket through the grid cell.
		
		\item Program of the control MCB has not been written.
		
		\item Program of the robot control by two joysticks has not been tested.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The MCB was finished.
		
		\item Programme of control MCB wasn't wrote.
		
		\item Program of the robot control by two joysticks wasn't tested.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To add to program of the robot control program of the management MCB.
		
		\item To test program of the robot control by two joysticks.
		
	\end{enumerate}

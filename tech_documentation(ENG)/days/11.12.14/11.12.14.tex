	\item Purposes of the meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To finish installation of steel crossbar on the lift.
		
		\item To add second servo on the MOB.
		
		\item To package the robot for transportation it to competition "Robofest-Ryazan".
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item It was installed another one crossbar. It was decided to leave aluminium axis with the tube on the bottom crossbar because steel axis can't get into the tube. In addition aluminium axis doesn't bend due to the tube. Also the tube reduces the friction becaise it can rotate on the axis.
		
		\item The aluminium axis with the tube was oiled for additional redusing the friction.

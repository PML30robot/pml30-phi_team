\section{Team PML 30 ${\varphi}$} 
	Team "PML 30 ${\varphi}$" was assembled in September 2014 in  the Russian city, St. Petersburg, from 3 novices and one experienced like as captain. Among the participants were assigned tasks and roles, set safety rules. In the first place in the team was put noble professional, spread it to the masses. All decisions taken collectively in team with discussion and finding optimal solutions. 
	During the year team took part in many events and everywhere we have tried attract our team and encourage people to take a part in FTC. Also everywhere pursuing and distribution the principles of noble professional. Talking with a press, we would like attract more attention to our team and to the competition in general, as well as attracting sponsors. The last was important because of needing funds for the purchase of materials and equipment, that cost really a lot.
	Team took part in the three qualifying competitions and the regional finals. In all of them make new contacts, share experience and provide mutual assistance with other teams. In the first qualifying rounds in Sochi we have contacts "Stuy  fission 310", team from USA, and maintain contact with them untill this day. On regional finals, we met a team from Romania "Autovortex" keep in touch by Facebook. Also, there is an active dialogue with many Russian teams. Team page in Facebook you can find the desired address: https://www.facebook.com/pages/FTC-team-PML30-PHI.
	To increase the efficiency of team work, was involved version control system GitHub, which allows the entire team to work simultaneously at the same project, without losing files and easy way to resolve problems. Also for writing technical books professional typesetting system latex has been used.

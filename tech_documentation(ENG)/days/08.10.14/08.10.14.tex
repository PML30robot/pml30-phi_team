\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of meeting: 18:30 - 21:40.
	\item Purposes of meeting:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Making the programme of control of robot via Bluetooth.
	  
	  \item Choosing of the optimal way of extracting the lift.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Programme of control of robot was changed. Limit was set so that when joystick's deviation is small the robot doesn't move. It allowed to avoid heavy load from the motors.
      
      \item It was carried out connection to robot via Bluetooth.
      
      \item The test of programme was successfull. We couldn't make the programme of autonomous period because we didn't connect encoders to drivers of motors. But we'll need encoders in a competition.
      
      \item We tested the ability of robot to climb to inclined plane. Robot can climb to hill with a slope angle of 30 degrees.
       
      \item We decided to use the construction with the eight transverse axes  for extracting of the lift (hereinafter they will be called as crossbars). They fixed between the slats. One crossbar is at the bottom of slate and one crossbar at the top of slat. In this case the line that is fixed at the bottom crossbar and thrown through the top crossbar extracts slat during the reeling of it.

      \item It was decided to use the belt instead of the line because it is more strong and it can't  entangle.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item It was made the programme of control robot via Bluetooth
	  
      \item It was elaborated the concept of mechanism of extraction of lift.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To buy the belt for extracting of the lift.
	  
	  \item To buy the aluminum profile for making the mounts of crossbars.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
